=== Introduction ===
These instructions will guide you to create a Gutenberg block using two plugins:
- Advanced Custom Fields PRO
- Advanced Custom Fields: Extended

=== Instructions ===
1. Go to ACF > Block Types and create a new block. For this example we will name it "demo".
2. All fields have a description, so I will only explain the specifics:
- Icon: We can use a dashicon by using their name, like "format-image", or use a svg element (just paste all the svg code).
- Render template: Just add "blocks/demo/template.php" (replace "demo" with the name of your block)
- Enqueue (only if you need styles or/and scripts): Add "blocks/demo/styles.min.css" and "blocks/demo/scripts.min.css" (replace "hero" with the name of your block). Minify files is always a good idea.
3. Now, we need the fields for this block. So we go to ACF > Field Groups. And we create a new one:
- Name: "Block: Demo"
- For every field, we use demo_ before the field name. For example: demo_call_to_action, demo_background, etc.
- Location: Show if Block is equal to NAME OF THE BLOCK (same as point 1)
4. Now, we need to code the template, styles and scripts for this block. So we create the files IN YOUR ACTIVE THEME:
- blocks/demo/template.php
- blocks/demo/styles.min.css (only if we call it in the point 2)
- blocks/demo/scripts.min.css (only if we call it in the point 2)
5. That's it! Now you should see your new block full working with your custom fields.
6. (Optional) You can later export your block and your fields in PHP and include theme in your theme or in a custom theme. Advanced Custom Fields: Extended Is no longer needed to properly work. ACF PRO is mandatory, though.
